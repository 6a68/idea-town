  <p>In addition to the <a href="/privacy">data</a> collected by all Test Pilot
    experiments, here are the key things you should know about what is happening
    when you use Universal Search:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We collect basic usage data regarding how you interact with the Awesome
      Bar (address bar), such as the number of characters typed, the types of
      results that you click, and their position in the results list.</li>
    <li>If you previously configured Firefox to display search suggestions in
      the Search Bar, installing Universal Search will enable <a
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#searchsuggestions"
      target="_blank">search suggestions</a> in the Awesome Bar.</li>
    <li>When you use the Awesome Bar, we send the terms you type to our
      recommendation engine. We keep anonymous logs of popular searches to
      improve the quality of our recommendations.</li>
    <li>To provide Universal Search, we use a few third-party services. We use
      <a href="http://www.bing.com/developers/s/APIBasics.html"
      target="_blank">Bing</a> and <a
      href="https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/search/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>
      to provide recommendations, and <a href="http://docs.embed.ly/docs/"
      target="_blank">Embedly</a> and <a href="https://clearbit.com/logo"
      target="_blank">Clearbit</a> to provide additional data (such as images or
      icons) about those recommendations. To display the recommendations in the
      Awesome Bar, Universal Search may download those images directly from
      Embedly and Clearbit, which may allow those services to see your IP address
      and the image requested.</li>

  <p>Universal Search was one of the three inaugural experiments that launched 
  with Test Pilot in May 2016. We wanted to learn if users would click on results 
  directly in the Awesome Bar. The short answer is: yes! When results were relevant, 
  users would click, and they told us the interaction was valuable.</p>
  <img src="/static/images/experiments/universal-search/experiments_experimentdetail/8/6/8675c7bf31054abdaf58b47850a1365d_image_1462827811_0451.jpg" alt="universal search preview" />
  <p>The Universal Search add-on turned on search suggestions in the Awesome Bar 
  and removed the standalone search bar. Most importantly, Universal Search inserted 
  a single search result directly into the top spot in the Awesome Bar for many user 
  searches. At launch, we served two types of results: top-level domains 
  (such as Facebook.com, Amazon.com, Youtube.com, etc), and specific Wikipedia article 
  pages pertaining to a user query.</p>
  <p>For the first two months, we showed users a result approximately 20% of the
  time they typed in the Awesome Bar, and users clicked on a displayed result
  about 10% of the time. In mid-July, we made a significant change to exclude
  showing a search result if the destination page was already in the user’s
  history. We expected this to dramatically reduce the frequency of results
  shown, and it did. Results displayed fell approximately 2/3, from 20% to 7%.
  What we didn’t expect was that the percentage of results clicked would also
  fall: we showed fewer results, and our click-through rate was worse.
  Intuitively this made sense. The duplicates we removed would include many
  sites that users revisit habitually, so our previously higher click-through
  rate included many clicks stolen from history navigation.</p>
  <p>In October 2016, we added a third result type, rich movie cards, which we
  hypothesized would be shown less often but clicked more frequently than the
  other types. A breakdown of clicks by result type showed that Wikipedia pages
  were shown most and clicked least. Top-level domains were the most consistent
  performer. Movie Cards had the least amount of test data, but outperformed
  Wikipedia pages. In aggregate, our click-through-rate for search results
  settled around 7% by the end of the experiment. In the graphs below, we have a
  data gap from July through the first week of August where we upgraded Test
  Pilot Telemetry.</p>
  <p>Besides Telemetry data, we also collected user sentiment via surveys. Users
  who left the experiment early spoke to a few themes. Some mentioned
  performance or stability issues, and we made some early fixes. Many users who
  left told us they wanted separate search and Awesome Bars: their learned
  habits were hard to overcome. Many who left also cited poor result quality.
  Search isn’t easy. Our better relevancy on top-level domains (even after de-
  duping) probably indicated we were short-cutting users to sites they already
  knew they wanted to visit.</p>
  <p>However, some of the most telling, representative survey feedback came from
  users who stayed. Universal Search had a high retention rate, and of the users
  who remained:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>65% agreed that Universal Search results were meaningful, and</li>
  <li>60% agreed that Universal Search helped them complete tasks faster.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In conclusion, Universal Search outperformed our expectations. We asked a
  simple question: would users click on results in the Awesome Bar. We had
  surprisingly high click-through rate for serving a mere three results types,
  and user sentiment was quite positive. The prototype we built was not a
  complete product experience, but it was enough to meet our learning goals, and
  we will now retire the experiment. If we tried a similar experiment again,
  we’d pursue better result relevancy and more diverse result types. As part of
  this first experiment, we did not test alternate UX treatments to see if we
  could affect interaction with results, or improve user acceptance of the
  combined Awesome Bar for those users who preferred separate bars. These are
  questions we may examine in future experiments.</p>
